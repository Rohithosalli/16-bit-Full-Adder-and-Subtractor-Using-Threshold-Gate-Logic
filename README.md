# 16-bit-Full-Adder-and-Subtractor-Using-Threshold-Gate-Logic
This repository contains the design, implementation, and simulation of a 16-bit full adder and 16-bit full subtractor using threshold gate logic. Threshold gates, known for their simplicity and efficiency, offer an alternative to traditional Boolean logic gates, achieving optimization in terms of power consumption and area.
